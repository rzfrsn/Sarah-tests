# PHP Script tests

In this repository, I've written code which are the answers of two tests. 

### TEST 1

Write a PHP script that makes a CURL POST request containing 2 params: param1 & param2.
In order to ensure the integrity and safety of the request, sign the request the best way you can think of.
Response is inside "test1.php".

## TEST 2

Write a PHP script to obtain the total download size of any URL.
Response is inside "test2.php".
